context: "In a C program, variables are stored in different regions in memory, depending\
  \ on where the variables have been initialized. Each memory region has different\
  \ properties about how the variables can be accessed, modified, ... This exercise\
  \ will show you how global variables and variables on the stack are managed.\n\n\
  .. code-block:: c\n\n    int result;\n\n    void sum1(int a1, int b1) {\n      \
  \  a1 = a1 + b1;\n    }\n\n    void main(int argc, char **argv) {\n        int a1\
  \ = 5, b1 = 6;\n\n        sum1(a1, b1);\n        printf(\"sum1: %d\\n\", a1);\n\n\
  \        int a2 = 3, b2 = 7;\n        sum2(a2, b2)\n        printf(\"sum2: %d\\\
  n\", result);\n\n        int a3 = 1, b3 = 8;\n        sum3(&a3, &b3);\n        printf(\"\

      are stored on the program''s stack. These variables are only accessible by the
      function in which they were declared.


      Moreover, passing arguments to functions, and returning values from a function,
      also use the stack, and use the mechanism of passing by value. Once a variable
      is passed by value, a copy of its value is placed on the stack.
