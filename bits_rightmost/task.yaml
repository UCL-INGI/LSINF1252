context: 'In this exercise, we will work with operation on bits. When we speak about
  the position of a bit, index 0 corresponds to lowest order bit, 1 to the second-lowest
  order bit, ...


  In C source code, you can write a number in binary (base 2) by prefixing it via
  0b., e.g. ``0b11010`` = 26.


  This exercise will introduce some non-standard data types which guarantee that the
  variable has a fixed number of bits. Indeed, on some machines, a *int* could use
  2, 4 or 8 bytes. Hence, if we want to perform bitwise operations, we have to know
  first on how many bits we are working.


  For this, C introduces a new class of variable types :


  - *int8_t* (signed integer of 8 bits)

  - *uint8_t* (unsigned integer of 8 bits)

  - *uint16_t* (unsigned integer of 16 bits)


  You can mix *uint* or *int* with bit-lengths 8, 16, 32 and 64). These types are
  defined in <stdint.h>'
