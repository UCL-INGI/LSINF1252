    Downloand the following `input <https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LSINF1252/s1_pipes/input.txt>`_ from where you want to extract an alphabetically **sorted** list of **unique** hashtags. This can easily be done with pipes. To only select hashtags from the input, you can either use ``sed '/ [^{#}]/d'`` or `grep(1) <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/grep.1.html>`_.
