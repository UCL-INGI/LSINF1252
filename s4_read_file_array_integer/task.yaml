  Given a binary file containing some (possibly none) positive integers (``int``)
  that were stored in the file by successive calls of ``write(fd,&num,sizeof(int))``
  write a code that computes the sum of all integers that were stored in the file.
  The function returns the sum when there are no errors. In case of errors, it returns.


  - If ``open()`` fails, return ``-1``.

  - If ``read()`` fails, return ``-2``.

  - If ``close()`` fails, return ``-3``.


  You can only use ``open(2)``, ``read(2)``, ``write(2)`` and ``close(2)``.'
