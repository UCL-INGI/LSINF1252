context: "*Estimated time: 25 minutes*\n\nYou are currently processing an array composed\
  \ of ``struct point`` defined below. In this programme, you need to store the content\
  \ of the entire array in a file to be able to reuse it later. Write a C function\
  \ to write the array composed of ``struct point`` into a file. The file may already\
  \ exist or not. After the execution of the function, the file should only contain\
  \ the array. If the file has to be created, the user who created it must have the\
  \ permission to read it.\n\n.. code-block:: c\n\n    typedef struct point {\n  \
  \      int x;\n        int y;\n        int z;\n    } point_t;\n\nUse only ``open(2)``,\
  \ ``write(2)`` and ``close(2)``. You can only call ``write(2)`` once.\n\nHint :\
  \ read carefully the man page of ``open(2)`` to manage all the  cases mentionned\
  \ above. Be sure to open the file with the appropriate rights."
